        <div class="subheading mb-5">Instructional AssitantðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My experience as a student who struggled academically has prepared me to be more empathetic and patient with students that I work with. My current job is at Mt. San Antonio Community College with the Writing Center Department. My official position title is called Instructional Support III, but most faculty know my position as Tutor in the Classroom (TC). As a TC, Iâ€™m embedded into various English classes at the beginning of each semester. The TC program originally had TCâ€™s assigned to new professors each semester; however, the TC program has slowly changed into a more consistent assignment of professors. Allowing TCâ€™s to be assigned the same professor each semester, it provides the tutor and professor an opportunity to a develop stronger professional relationship to better support students with class material and subjects. This means that communication between the tutor and professor will be clear and the teaching style of the professor will be better understood by the TC instead of trying to adapt to each new professor every semester.<br><br>

        With communication and collaboration established with the professor, my focus is mostly on supporting students. I support students when in class and outside of it. I attend each class session with the students unless the professor communicates that Iâ€™m not need that day. During class, I support the professor by dividing the attention each students gets in the class while doing activities. Iâ€™ll answer as many questions as I can for the students and challenge them to critically think about different subjects that theyâ€™re exposed to by using the Socratic Method. Iâ€™ve been assigned to American Language classes designed for Non-Native English Speakers, English 1A, English 1C and even a Political Science class, so Iâ€™ve learned to adjust and improvise the types of challenging questions I ask students to cultivate their critical thinking skills. Outside of class, Iâ€™m responsible for setting and creating a schedule based on student survey of availability, so students can easily access to make one-on-one thirty minute appointments with me or to join a weekly one hour group session.<br><br>

        During one-on-one thirty minute appointments, students and I will work on any part of the writing process that involves their class or even at times other classes that have writing assignments. Iâ€™ve worked with students that have come fully prepared and confident in their work to students who are stressed and lost in a sea of assignments. While appointments give me the opportunity to create stronger one-on-one connections with students, group sessions are planned sessions by me that allows me to see more of how the students work as a group. I usually create a lesson plan every week based on a combination of what the professor is teaching at the time and what I or the professor is noticing the students are struggling with the most. If the students show a stronger understanding or have much bigger concerns with another area in the class than Iâ€™ll adapt to focus on something different or with their concerns.<br><br>

I remember how terrible I felt not doing will in my English classes. I remember the frustration of not understanding the material or the fear of looking dumb when seeking help for something others learned long ago. It devastated me to fail over and over again in English. When I finally learned how to manage struggles in English, I knew I wanted to help others like me because I didnâ€™t want other students to suffer in their English classes.
